What were the consequences of that fall? The course sets out a basic timeline of events, then turns to literary and philosophical sources to illustrate the dynasty’s internal weaknesses during its last half century. Externally, the Japanese invasion of Korea was another destabilizer, as can again be shown through literary and philosophical readings. The fall had profound repercussions within China, paving the way for a new Qing (Manchu)Dynasty and reshaping some areas of Chinese culture, with additional repercussions in the literatures of Korea and Japan. Not long after the transition, accounts of events turn up in the literatures of England, Holland, and France, some of which seem quite fanciful if one knows the Chinese side of the story. Overall, this picture provides a sense of China’s place in regional and world culture nearly four hundred years before the present day."},{"regNum":13618,"credit":1,"enrollment":13,"available":12,"max":25,"day":["W"],"time1":["02:15 pm"],"time2":["04:45 pm"],"distr":"ARS - Arts, Music, Theatre, Film and Video; LL - Language and Literature","prereqs":"None ","raw":["CRN: 13618; Credit Hours: 1; Current Enrollment: 13; Seats Available: 12; Max Enrollment: 25;","Meeting Time(s): W - 02:15 pm - 04:45 pm","Crosslisted courses:  CHIN 344 01 - Classical Chinese Theater(Eng)\n","Distributions: ARS - Arts, Music, Theatre, Film and Video; LL - Language and Literature","Prerequisites(s): None ","Notes: \n"],"title":"CHIN 244 Classical Chinese Theater (in English)","professor":"Ellen Widmer","description":"<p>This course covers three basic categories of traditional theater in China.

Critics of world literature argue that a text’s richness may be lost in translation, that too often a privileged Western literary tradition forces “other” literatures into a relationship of belatedness and inferiority, and that world literature leads to the globalization of culture—and as the global language becomes predominantly English, the world of literature will be known through that single language alone. This course offers an opportunity to not only read rich and exciting literary texts from ancient eras to the contemporary moment but also after reading key critical essays that defend and critique “World Literature” to reflect on the cultural politics that directly or indirectly determines who reads what. Likely texts among others:&nbsp;<em>The Homeric Hymn to Demeter;&nbsp;</em>Ovid,&nbsp;<em>Metamorphoses</em>; Murasaki,&nbsp;<em>The Tale of the Genji</em>; Qu,&nbsp;<em>The Lament</em>; Poe,&nbsp;<em>Tales</em>; Dove,&nbsp;<em>Mother Love</em>; Akutagawa,&nbsp;<em>Stories</em>; Soyinka,&nbsp;<em>Aké</em>; Ma,&nbsp;<em>Red Dust</em>; Spivak, “Crossing Borders”; Saussy, “Exquisite Cadavers Stitched from Fresh Nightmares: Of Memes, Hives, and Selfish Genes”; Cao, “Cross-Civilization Variation Theory.\" </p>"},{"regNum":13826,"credit":1,"enrollment":28,"available":2,"max":30,"day":["MTh"],"time1":["09:50 am"],"time2":["11:00 am"],"distr":"EC - Epistemology and Cognition; LL - Language and Literature","prereqs":"None ","raw":["CRN: 13826; Credit Hours: 1; Current Enrollment: 28; Seats Available: 2; Max Enrollment: 30;","Meeting Time(s): MTh - 09:50 am - 11:00 am","Crosslisted courses:  CLCV 209 01 - Intro to Cognitive Poetics\n","Distributions: EC - Epistemology and Cognition; LL - Language and Literature","Prerequisites(s): None ","Permission of Instructor: Required"],"title":"CPLT 209 Literature On the Brain: Introduction to Cognitive Poetics ","professor":"Elizabeth Young","description":"What happens to your brain when you read a poem and find yourself laughing out loud or wrinkling your nose in disgust?  What makes a story feel “nightmarish,” “trancelike” or “dreamy” and can we pinpoint the features that generate such impressions? Why do we care so much about characters we meet in books? Cognitive poetics is an emerging approach to literary studies that seeks to answer such questions.  It applies insights drawn from cognitive science, psychology and linguistics to literary texts to reveal how novels and poems make us feel the way they do. Each week, we will read cutting edge research in this exciting new field and ask how it helps us make sense of literary texts. These texts will range widely through different languages, cultures and times, from ancient Greek epics to contemporary science fiction. The course will appeal to students with interests in literature, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, medicine and beyond but it requires no previous experience in any of these areas."},{"regNum":13772,"credit":1,"enrollment":25,"available":0,"max":25,"day":["TF"],"time1":["01:30 pm"],"time2":["02:40 pm"],"distr":"ARS - Arts, Music, Theatre, Film and Video; LL - Language and Literature","prereqs":"None ","raw":["CRN: 13772; Credit Hours: 1; Current Enrollment: 25; Seats Available: 0; Max Enrollment: 25;","Meeting Time(s): TF - 01:30 pm - 02:40 pm","Crosslisted courses:  EALC 236 01 - The Girl in East Asia\n","Distributions: ARS - Arts, Music, Theatre, Film and Video; LL - Language and Literature","Prerequisites(s): None ","Permission of Instructor: Required","Waitlist Type: Centralized Waitlist","First come first serve: Yes","Waitlist Notes: As spots become available, students will be offered seats in the class on a first come first served basis.

How does the objectification of the adolescent girl illuminate issues around ethnicity, national identity, sexuality, even globalization? What national anxieties hover around girls’ bodies? We read texts in English translation and explore models of female development that might aid us in our exploration of this cultural phenomenon. Secondary readings include works by Sigmund Freud, Julia Kristeva, Marianne Hirsch, Carol Gilligan, Elizabeth Grosz, among others."},{"regNum":10088,"credit":1,"enrollment":12,"available":21,"max":33,"day":["MTh"," W1"],"time1":["09:50 am","09:50 am"],"time2":["11:00 am","11:00 am"],"distr":"SBA - Social and Behavioral Analysis","prereqs":"Fulfillment of the basic skills component of the Quantitative Reasoning requirement.

As we ponder such questions, our primary focus will be on literature (including Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Emily Bronte, Christina Rossetti, Proust, Conan Doyle, Woolf, Borges, Nabokov, Morrison). We shall also draw on philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science and explore creative arts such as drawing, photography, painting, sculpture, book arts, film, and music.

The course concludes with a reflection on narrative technique in cinema illustrated by the films of Antonioni. Other authors to be studied may include Calvino, Ceresa, Rasy, Pasolini, Celati, and Benni.</p>"},{"regNum":10201,"credit":1,"enrollment":5,"available":10,"max":15,"day":["MTThF"],"time1":["08:30 am"],"time2":["09:40 am"],"distr":" - None","prereqs":"None ","raw":["CRN: 10201; Credit Hours: 1.25; Current Enrollment: 5; Seats Available: 10; Max Enrollment: 15;","Meeting Time(s): MTThF - 08:30 am - 09:40 am","Distributions:  - None","Prerequisites(s): None ","Notes: Each semester of JPN 101 and JPN 102 earns 1.25 unit of credit; however, both semesters must be completed satisfactorily to receive credit for either course."],"title":"JPN 101 Beginning Japanese","professor":"Eiko Torii-Williams","description":"<p>Introduction to the modern standard Japanese language.

Students engage directly with these topics by analyzing cultural phenomena, from geisha to baseball, in light of historical and theoretical perspectives drawn from the disciplines of literary criticism, cultural studies, film studies, and anthropology—all in an effort to understand Japan through patterns of consumption, cultural memory, gender, media, national identity, race, and sexuality.

In reality, however, there are many instances of asymmetric conflicts involving non-state actors who avoid open battles, whose fighters are indistinguishable from civilians, and who seek a wide variety of political objectives. Peasant revolts, communist insurrections, ethnic rebellions, and terrorist movements are among the various ways in which the weak have attempted to use violence to break the will of the strong. We address these wars from a theoretical, historical, and contemporary perspective. We will explore how classical theorists, including Mao Zedong and Che Guevara, adapted the ideas of Clausewitz to guerilla warfare. We will examine how rebel groups—whether the Spanish guerillas, Boer commandos, Chinese communists, or Serb militias—employed violence to intimidate their opponents. We will consider how globalization and the diffusion of military technology have transformed guerilla conflicts, and debate the implications of our theories for contemporary conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan.</p>"},{"regNum":14105,"credit":1,"enrollment":28,"available":7,"max":35,"day":["MTh"],"time1":["02:50 pm"],"time2":["04:00 pm"],"distr":"REP - Religion, Ethics and Moral Philosophy","prereqs":"None.

In this course, students will learn about food systems from multiple perspectives, considering how food is produced, distributed, consumed, and regulated. They will learn how those systems are influenced by factors ranging from micronutrients to McDonald’s to Michelle Obama. They will also study the ways in which food is examined and discussed by different groups, including scientists, corporate leaders, and social justice advocates. Students will develop an understanding of food system dynamics by writing about it for various audiences, from school children to scholars."},{"regNum":14138,"credit":1,"enrollment":0,"available":15,"max":15,"day":["MTh"," W"],"time1":["01:30 pm","11:10 am"],"time2":["02:40 pm","12:20 pm"],"distr":"W - W","prereqs":"None.

Students will learn about activity practices and cultural attitudes toward exercise, from ancient times to the present day, with a special emphasis on exercise within educational settings. They will also learn about today’s cutting-edge research on the subject, gaining an understanding of the principles and mechanisms associated with physical activity and the beneficial influences it exerts on body and mind. In addition, students will examine emerging exercise science applications and public health policies that impact wellness lifestyle choices and standards in schools and colleges.

We will examine what happens to art as it moves from short story to stage, from board game to cult film, from graphic novel to Tony-winning musical and beyond. We will explore what motivates an artist to adapt a work into a new medium, considering what is gained or lost in the process of re-creation. Our work will be to understand the form, content, and social context of various artistic sources, to assess public and critical reception of their adapted forms, and to propose potential new directions for artistic re-creation."},{"regNum":14209,"credit":1,"enrollment":0,"available":15,"max":15,"day":["MTh"],"time1":["11:10 am"],"time2":["12:20 pm"],"distr":"W - W","prereqs":"None.

These events will be part of a series on South Asian performance arts presented by the Newhouse Center for the Humanities and will include a dynamic lecture, a dance and movement recital, and a large-scale group performance that draws on classical Indian dance forms as well as modern forms such as globalized hip-hop. We will focus on the particular challenges of writing on performance, as we consider the role of personal experience and interactivity, the place of the human body, and the vocabulary necessary for describing and evaluating performance for different types of readers."},{"regNum":14140,"credit":1,"enrollment":0,"available":15,"max":15,"day":["MTh"],"time1":["02:50 pm"],"time2":["04:00 pm"],"distr":"W - W","prereqs":"None.

The course explores the tradition chronologically, reading love poems, romances, and other works across historical periods, beginning with classical and biblical traditions, moving through the Middle Ages and early modernity, and finishing in modern day. The course will be arranged in units focusing on the construction, deconstruction, modernization, and socio-political value of love literature; students will be required to do significant writing on each of these themes. The figures of the lover and the beloved will be paramount to our discussions and writings, and we will consider them in terms of their political, religious, social, and gendered contexts."},{"regNum":14141,"credit":1,"enrollment":4,"available":6,"max":10,"day":["TF"],"time1":["02:50 pm"],"time2":["04:00 pm"],"distr":" - None","prereqs":"Completion of First-Year Writing requirement.

Students will design an individualized syllabus around a topic of interest to them and focused on the areas of writing in which they most want to improve. Building on what they learned in their 100-level WRIT course, students will become more adept at working with sources, developing their thinking, and communicating their ideas clearly and purposefully. There will be two class meetings per week. In one, all students will meet as a group with the professor, engaging in writing workshops and discussing some short common readings. In the second meeting, students will meet individually with a TA to discuss readings on their own topic and to work on their writing."}]
