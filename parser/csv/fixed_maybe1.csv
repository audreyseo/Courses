Students will critically engage Obama's writings and speaking, including his biography, sense of identity, and political philosophy. We will move to the events of his presidential campaign to understand his electoral victory, examining representations of Obama during and after the 2008 and 2012 elections. Instead of only situating President Obama in American history, or giving his supporters a platform to celebrate his ascendance, this seminar will ask students to unpack that ascendancy over the&nbsp|past eight years&nbsp|and to engage the broader discourses that make him a political and cultural lightning rod.[|];;;

The Western imagination rendered the peoples and the rich cultures of the area as backward, violent, and underdeveloped. This course examines the imagery of the area and its people through film. We will explore the use of history by filmmakers and the use of films in understanding a number of issues in the history of the Balkans. The course will trace the adoration of ancient Greek antiquity, the legacy of Byzantium and Orthodox Christianity as well as the Ottoman influence and the appearance of Islam. The historical past is (re)constructed and (re)presented in film, as are the national awakenings and liberation movements. The list of films we will watch and the anthropological and historical readings we will do aspire to cover various aspects of Balkan societies as revealed through visual and cinematic representations. Balkan film is politically, socially, and historically engaged, and we will use film narratives and stories to understand the area's diverse landscapes and cultures, religions and identities, love and hatred.;;;

With the spread of "Bollywood" films beyond the subcontinent, and with American television now representing Indian culture during prime time, an anthropological perspective on South Asian visual culture is particularly timely. In this course, we will examine many of the diverse visual forms and practices of the region from an anthropological perspective&mdash|that is, focusing on the social practices and cultural formations that arise around and shape them. We will learn how anthropologists study South Asian visual practices, including photography, film, textiles, and comic books, and assess the implications of these practices for Western theories about visuality and modernity.;;;

The treatment of Native Americans as a subject for study has left a legacy across the social and natural sciences of thinking of Native peoples as research entities of the past, even as they remain communities of the present. Throughout anthropology&rsquo|s history, the discipline has played a paradoxical role in adding to our knowledge of North American prehistory and human biological variation, while contributing to the systematic erasure of the idea of contemporary Native peoples.&nbsp|;;;

We will trace the ways the region is enmeshed in transnational processes and migrations and analyze the intersection of culture, race, gender, and class in shaping urban centers, rural hinterlands, and livelihood strategies within them. In particular, we will discuss how ethnographic research – the long-term fieldwork conducted by anthropologists – can enrich our understanding of hotly debated issues such as statecraft, borders, and shifting meanings of citizenship| in/security, human rights, and democratization| and, illicit economies, extractive industries, and development.;;;

We will also consider social responses to ethnographic film in terms of the contexts for producing and circulating these works| the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation| and the development of indigenous media and other practices in conversation with ethnographic film.

The second unit will examine in more detail the genetic basis of phenotypic traits and disease, exploring what our genes can reveal about us while also considering the problems of biological determinism. The final unit will extend the understanding of human biological variation by looking at the relationship between humans and our environment, how our environment changed throughout prehistory and contemporary times, and what role the environment plays in shaping human variation.;;;

The emergent structure and function of ecosystems are regulated by feedbacks between biological and physical systems from the microscopic to the global scale. We will study how ecosystems cycle carbon and nutrients and how the energy balance of ecosystems creates critical feedbacks with climate. We will also examine the role that humans play in managing, creating, and using services from ecosystems in our current era of rapid global change.
