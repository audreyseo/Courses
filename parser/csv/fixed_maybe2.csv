Students will critically engage Obama's writings and speaking, including his biography, sense of identity, and political philosophy. We will move to the events of his presidential campaign to understand his electoral victory, examining representations of Obama during and after the 2008 and 2012 elections. Instead of only situating President Obama in American history, or giving his supporters a platform to celebrate his ascendance, this seminar will ask students to unpack that ascendancy over the&nbsp|past eight years&nbsp|and to engage the broader discourses that make him a political and cultural lightning rod.[|];;;

The Western imagination rendered the peoples and the rich cultures of the area as backward, violent, and underdeveloped. This course examines the imagery of the area and its people through film. We will explore the use of history by filmmakers and the use of films in understanding a number of issues in the history of the Balkans. The course will trace the adoration of ancient Greek antiquity, the legacy of Byzantium and Orthodox Christianity as well as the Ottoman influence and the appearance of Islam. The historical past is (re)constructed and (re)presented in film, as are the national awakenings and liberation movements. The list of films we will watch and the anthropological and historical readings we will do aspire to cover various aspects of Balkan societies as revealed through visual and cinematic representations. Balkan film is politically, socially, and historically engaged, and we will use film narratives and stories to understand the area's diverse landscapes and cultures, religions and identities, love and hatred.;;;

With the spread of "Bollywood" films beyond the subcontinent, and with American television now representing Indian culture during prime time, an anthropological perspective on South Asian visual culture is particularly timely. In this course, we will examine many of the diverse visual forms and practices of the region from an anthropological perspective&mdash|that is, focusing on the social practices and cultural formations that arise around and shape them. We will learn how anthropologists study South Asian visual practices, including photography, film, textiles, and comic books, and assess the implications of these practices for Western theories about visuality and modernity.;;;

The treatment of Native Americans as a subject for study has left a legacy across the social and natural sciences of thinking of Native peoples as research entities of the past, even as they remain communities of the present. Throughout anthropology&rsquo|s history, the discipline has played a paradoxical role in adding to our knowledge of North American prehistory and human biological variation, while contributing to the systematic erasure of the idea of contemporary Native peoples.&nbsp|;;;

We will trace the ways the region is enmeshed in transnational processes and migrations and analyze the intersection of culture, race, gender, and class in shaping urban centers, rural hinterlands, and livelihood strategies within them. In particular, we will discuss how ethnographic research – the long-term fieldwork conducted by anthropologists – can enrich our understanding of hotly debated issues such as statecraft, borders, and shifting meanings of citizenship| in/security, human rights, and democratization| and, illicit economies, extractive industries, and development.;;;

We will also consider social responses to ethnographic film in terms of the contexts for producing and circulating these works| the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation| and the development of indigenous media and other practices in conversation with ethnographic film.

The second unit will examine in more detail the genetic basis of phenotypic traits and disease, exploring what our genes can reveal about us while also considering the problems of biological determinism. The final unit will extend the understanding of human biological variation by looking at the relationship between humans and our environment, how our environment changed throughout prehistory and contemporary times, and what role the environment plays in shaping human variation.;;;

We'll also consider how consumers of media representations can and do contest and unsettle their embedded messages. Our emphasis will be on developing the research and analytical tools, modes of reading, and forms of critical practice that can help us to negotiate the increasingly mediated world in which we live.;;;

Open to first-year students only.;An introduction to the cinematic experience, this course explores the excitement of recent global filmmaking with a special focus on independent and animated films to which students are unlikely to have been exposed so far (e.g. independent art films). Through selected films and readings, the seminar examines the basic elements of filmic language including mise-en-sc&egrave|ne, editing, cinematography, the relation of sound to image, and narrative structure. The major novelty of this seminar is its emphasis on the production of audiovisual essays. Students will learn the basics of videography, engaging with the material in a hands-on fashion. The kind of cinemas examined and the videography component make this seminar a must for adventurous minds interested in the multifaceted potential of audiovisual language.;;;

This course charts a path through this universe by casting a spotlight on exemplary constellations: films that captured our imagination, significant artists, groundbreaking movements, transnational synergies. Part 2 surveys postwar film history until the end of the twentieth century. We examine the worldwide emergence and energy of new cinemas during the epochal changes brought about by sexual and cultural revolutions, postcolonialism, and multiculturalism. Against the background of a shifting world order and technological transformations affecting how films are made, distributed, and viewed, we shall explore the vexed question of art cinema's implicit opposition to the ethos of fast consumption, asking ourselves: whither cinema after its hundredth anniversary?;;;

This chemical biology approach has opened up exciting new areas of study, such as the biosynthesis of drug molecules and modern materials, the engineering of cells to incorporate "unnatural" biomolecules, and the development of improved approaches to study biological processes in vivo</em>. In this course, juniors and seniors will explore contemporary research breakthroughs in chemical biology through readings in the primary literature, attending invited seminars and interviewing active researchers. Students will analyze and interpret these research findings through a variety of weekly writing assignments targeted towards educated readers in other disciplines, such as research summaries for the scientific press, website profiles, textbook sections and executive summaries. Class sections will be structured as workshops to analyze core chemical and biological concepts in addition to providing structured critiques of writing assignments.;;;

What were the consequences of that fall? The course sets out a basic timeline of events, then turns to literary and philosophical sources to illustrate the dynasty&rsquo|s internal weaknesses during its last half century. Externally, the Japanese invasion of Korea was another destabilizer, as can again be shown through literary and philosophical readings. The fall had profound repercussions within China, paving the way for a new Qing (Manchu)Dynasty and reshaping some areas of Chinese culture, with additional repercussions in the literatures of Korea and Japan. Not long after the transition, accounts of events turn up in the literatures of England, Holland, and France, some of which seem quite fanciful if one knows the Chinese side of the story. Overall, this picture provides a sense of China&rsquo|s place in regional and world culture nearly four hundred years before the present day.;;;

Individual filmic visions and techniques experimented with by important directors such as Fei Mu, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Zhang Yimou, and Jia Zhangke will be closely analyzed. Class discussions will aim to help students understand the history, politics, and aesthetics of Chinese cinema.
