The Western imagination rendered the peoples and the rich cultures of the area as backward, violent, and underdeveloped. This course examines the imagery of the area and its people through film. We will explore the use of history by filmmakers and the use of films in understanding a number of issues in the history of the Balkans. The course will trace the adoration of ancient Greek antiquity, the legacy of Byzantium and Orthodox Christianity as well as the Ottoman influence and the appearance of Islam. The historical past is (re)constructed and (re)presented in film, as are the national awakenings and liberation movements. The list of films we will watch and the anthropological and historical readings we will do aspire to cover various aspects of Balkan societies as revealed through visual and cinematic representations. Balkan film is politically, socially, and historically engaged, and we will use film narratives and stories to understand the area's diverse landscapes and cultures, religions and identities, love and hatred.;;;

In this course, we will examine many of the diverse visual forms and practices of the region from an anthropological perspective&mdash|that is, focusing on the social practices and cultural formations that arise around and shape them. We will learn how anthropologists study South Asian visual practices, including photography, film, textiles, and comic books, and assess the implications of these practices for Western theories about visuality and modernity.;;;

The treatment of Native Americans as a subject for study has left a legacy across the social and natural sciences of thinking of Native peoples as research entities of the past, even as they remain communities of the present. Throughout anthropology&rsquo|s history, the discipline has played a paradoxical role in adding to our knowledge of North American prehistory and human biological variation, while contributing to the systematic erasure of the idea of contemporary Native peoples.&nbsp|;;;

What were the consequences of that fall? The course sets out a basic timeline of events, then turns to literary and philosophical sources to illustrate the dynasty&rsquo|s internal weaknesses during its last half century. Externally, the Japanese invasion of Korea was another destabilizer, as can again be shown through literary and philosophical readings. The fall had profound repercussions within China, paving the way for a new Qing (Manchu)Dynasty and reshaping some areas of Chinese culture, with additional repercussions in the literatures of Korea and Japan. Not long after the transition, accounts of events turn up in the literatures of England, Holland, and France, some of which seem quite fanciful if one knows the Chinese side of the story. Overall, this picture provides a sense of China&rsquo|s place in regional and world culture nearly four hundred years before the present day.;;;

We read texts in English translation and explore models of female development that might aid us in our exploration of this cultural phenomenon. Secondary readings include works by Sigmund Freud, Julia Kristeva, Marianne Hirsch, Carol Gilligan, Elizabeth Grosz, among others.;;;

How do individuals, communities, and political structures change?  This seminar combines a reading of the social science literature on change with our own efforts to put that information into action. We’ll figure out how to change our own habits, change someone else’s mind, and how to invoke or transform community norms.  We’ll experiment with what approaches to political change succeed or fail. We’ll also examine what types of change are most important: does it matter whether people undertake their behavior for the right reasons, or simply that they act in ways that are better for environmental protection?  When should we focus on changing behavior by individuals, and when should we focus on changing the structures within which that behavior happens?;;;

Is scientific or cultural knowledge relevant to the aesthetic experience of nature? Does “natural beauty” have a role to play in guiding environmental preservation? When we seek to preserve an ecosystem or a building, what exactly should we be aiming to preserve? Should the history of a place guide our interactions with it? How should we navigate conflicts between environmental and cultural preservation, especially as they intersect with issues of race and class? How should a changing climate affect our environmental values? We will investigate these questions, among others, in contexts from wilderness to parks, cities to ruins.;;;

These cannot be understood without a consideration of both the specific history of South Asia and a broader account of urban change. This course examines these changes in historical perspective and situates urban South Asia within a global context. How did colonial rule transform old cities such as Delhi and Lahore? How were the differing ideologies of India and Pakistan mapped onto new capitals such as Chandigarh and Islamabad? How are ethnic pasts and techno futures reconciled in booming cities such as Bangalore and Mumbai? What are the connections between the urban environment and political mobilization? We consider a range of sources, including scholarly literature, films, and short stories.;;;

Our primary focus is the war in Europe, including Poland and Russia, although we will also consider the United States and Japan. We will investigate the construction of individual and collective memories about World War II and the creation and subsequent transformation of set myths about the war experience.

Areas of inquiry will include the intersections between U.S. visual culture and race relations, African Americans' use of visual culture as a means of self- and group-expression, and the state's use of black media images. This exploration will take us through a study of Jim Crow politics, black migrations and artistic movement, U.S. foreign relations and conflicts, and the development of marketing and advertising.&nbsp|;;;

This culminated in Partition and the emergence of the nations of India and Pakistan. Independence was marred, however, by the bloodshed accompanying the mass movements of Muslims into Pakistan and Hindus into India. What were the factors leading to this juxtaposition of triumphal Independence with shameful Partition? How have memories of Partition continued to affect powerfully politics and culture in the subcontinent? This seminar investigates such questions using a wide variety of materials, including novels, such as Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children</em> and Bapsi Sidhwa's Cracking India</em>| feature films, such as Deepa Mehta's 1947</em>| and documentary films, such as Sabiha Sumar's Silent Waters</em>.;;;

Two questions will animate the course: What is a friend? And, why are friends valuable? Drawing examples from literature and films, we will examine different types of friendships and the features that characterize and sustain them. Many philosophers have argued that the best kind of friendship is one in which the friend is loved for her own sake| we will consider whether this is truly possible or whether all friendships are ultimately instrumental. We'll also examine how the partiality inherent in friendship conflicts with the demands of standard moral theories. Finally, we will compare the love that characterizes friendship with the feelings that sustain relationships with parents, children, and lovers.;;;

We will first consider the nature of law and legal reasoning. Is law derived from moral principles or created by legislative fiat? Is international “law” law? When judges interpret the Constitution, do they discover the law or, in effect, make it up as they go along? We will then discuss moral limits on the law.  Which principles should guide the state’s restriction of citizens’ liberties? Is refusal to obey the law ever justified? We will also consider the legal issues surrounding responsibility and penalties. Under which circumstances can we hold people responsible for outcomes that they caused or could have prevented?  What, if anything, justifies punishment by the state?  Does the death penalty violate human rights? Readings will include selections from legal theory and contemporary court decisions.;;;

How should we understand the value of nature? Is it relative to human interests, or independent of them? What is nature in the first place, and how is it distinguished from culture? Is scientific or cultural knowledge relevant to the aesthetic experience of nature? Does “natural beauty” have a role to play in guiding environmental preservation? When we seek to preserve an ecosystem or a building, what exactly should we be aiming to preserve? Should the history of a place guide our interactions with it? How should we navigate conflicts between environmental and cultural preservation, especially as they intersect with issues of race and class? How should a changing climate affect our environmental values? We will investigate these questions, among others, in contexts from wilderness to parks, cities to ruins.;;;

This seminar will approach these questions via an exploration of key aspects of liberal political philosophy, focusing on freedom, individual rights and toleration of diverse ways of life. We will discuss classic texts in the liberal tradition, contemporary developments in liberal thought and controversies in current affairs that turn on liberal themes. We will also consider some important critiques of liberalism, including those from conservatives, communitarians and feminists. Some questions that we&rsquo|ll look at along the way include: Which kinds of freedom matter, and why? What&rsquo|s the proper relationship between individuals and the social order? Deep down, does liberalism conflict with religion? Do liberals emphasize liberty and individuality at the expense of justice, virtue, human flourishing or a meaningful life? Is a genuinely liberal society possible?;;;

In reality, however, there are many instances of asymmetric conflicts involving non-state actors who avoid open battles, whose fighters are indistinguishable from civilians, and who seek a wide variety of political objectives. Peasant revolts, communist insurrections, ethnic rebellions, and terrorist movements are among the various ways in which the weak have attempted to use violence to break the will of the strong. We address these wars from a theoretical, historical, and contemporary perspective. We will explore how classical theorists, including Mao Zedong and Che Guevara, adapted the ideas of Clausewitz to guerilla warfare. We will examine how rebel groups&mdash|whether the Spanish guerillas, Boer commandos, Chinese communists, or Serb militias&mdash|employed violence to intimidate their opponents. We will consider how globalization and the diffusion of military technology have transformed guerilla conflicts, and debate the implications of our theories for contemporary conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan.;;;

Beginning with consideration of the social construction of childhood, the course will examine the images, ideas, and expectations that constitute childhoods in various historical and cultural contexts. We will also consider the roles of children as social actors who contribute to and construct social worlds of their own. Specific topics to be covered include the historical development of childhood as a distinct phase of life, children&rsquo|s peer cultures, children and work, children&rsquo|s use of public spaces, children&rsquo|s intersectional experiences of inequality, and the effects of consumer culture upon children. Considerable attention will be given to the dynamics of the social institutions most directly affecting childhood today: the family, education, and the state.[|];;;

Who were the writers, and for whom were they writing? What role did Buddhism and Shinto play? How were the concepts of longing and dream transformed into a unique esthetic that has continued to influence Japanese culture? For 300 level credit students will read selections from the works covered in class in the original Japanese during an extra weekly class meeting.;;;

Open only to first-year students.;In this course we will investigate the transformative journey art takes when it is adapted for performance. We will examine what happens to art as it moves from short story to stage, from board game to cult film, from graphic novel to Tony-winning musical and beyond. We will explore what motivates an artist to adapt a work into a new medium, considering what is gained or lost in the process of re-creation. Our work will be to understand the form, content, and social context of various artistic sources, to assess public and critical reception of their adapted forms, and to propose potential new directions for artistic re-creation.;;;

We will focus on the particular challenges of writing on performance, as we consider the role of personal experience and interactivity, the place of the human body, and the vocabulary necessary for describing and evaluating performance for different types of readers.;;;

Students will design an individualized syllabus around a topic of interest to them and focused on the areas of writing in which they most want to improve. Building on what they learned in their 100-level WRIT course, students will become more adept at working with sources, developing their thinking, and communicating their ideas clearly and purposefully. There will be two class meetings per week. In one, all students will meet as a group with the professor, engaging in writing workshops and discussing some short common readings. In the second meeting, students will meet individually with a TA to discuss readings on their own topic and to work on their writing.;;;

Working in small teams, students will identify an area of need with their organization, gather information and research ways to best approach this issue, and write a grant seeking funding to address this area of need. At the conclusion of the course, students will fund one or more of these grants through a generous award from the Learning by Giving Foundation. A significant component of this course will involve learning how to write in a professional context and how to collaborate effectively on a project of consequence.&nbsp| Our aim is to provide students with a set of communication skills transferable to a variety of different fields and ones that will prepare them for the kinds of writing they will do beyond the Wellesley classroom.;;;
