13966;ANTH 219 Balkan Cinematic Representations;ANTH;219;Balkan Cinematic Representations;Th;06:00 pm;08:30 pm ;Pendleton Hall East-239;Pendleton Hall East;239;1;4;16;20;;SBA;Social and Behavioral Analysis;(s);In the course of Europe's road to modernity, the southeastern corner of the continent became known as the Balkans. The Western imagination rendered the peoples and the rich cultures of the area as backward, violent, and underdeveloped. This course examines the imagery of the area and its people through film. We will explore the use of history by filmmakers and the use of films in understanding a number of issues in the history of the Balkans. The course will trace the adoration of ancient Greek antiquity, the legacy of Byzantium and Orthodox Christianity as well as the Ottoman influence and the appearance of Islam. The historical past is (re)constructed and (re)presented in film, as are the national awakenings and liberation movements. The list of films we will watch and the anthropological and historical readings we will do aspire to cover various aspects of Balkan societies as revealed through visual and cinematic representations. Balkan film is politically, socially, and historically engaged, and we will use film narratives and stories to understand the area's diverse landscapes and cultures, religions and identities, love and hatred.
14069;ANTH 239 Visual Culture of South Asia;ANTH;239;Visual Culture of South Asia;TF;09:50 am;11:00 am ;Pendleton Hall East-130;Pendleton Hall East;130;1;6;14;20;;ARS;SBA;(s);The Indian subcontinent is iconic for its rich and varied visual traditions&mdash|from Mughal miniatures to calendar art, monumental architecture to television soap operas. With the spread of "Bollywood" films beyond the subcontinent, and with American television now representing Indian culture during prime time, an anthropological perspective on South Asian visual culture is particularly timely. In this course, we will examine many of the diverse visual forms and practices of the region from an anthropological perspective&mdash|that is, focusing on the social practices and cultural formations that arise around and shape them. We will learn how anthropologists study South Asian visual practices, including photography, film, textiles, and comic books, and assess the implications of these practices for Western theories about visuality and modernity.
14070;ANTH 243 The (In)Visible Native America: Past and Present;ANTH;243;The (In)Visible Native America: Past and Present;MTh;09:50 am;11:00 am ;Pendleton Hall East-127;Pendleton Hall East;127;1;13;7;20;;SBA;Social and Behavioral Analysis;(s);This course will examine the historical significance of Native Americans within anthropology as well as the contemporary challenge of defining Native American identity in a scientific context.&nbsp|The study of indigenous North American populations played a major role in the early formation of American anthropology as a discipline. The treatment of Native Americans as a subject for study has left a legacy across the social and natural sciences of thinking of Native peoples as research entities of the past, even as they remain communities of the present. Throughout anthropology&rsquo|s history, the discipline has played a paradoxical role in adding to our knowledge of North American prehistory and human biological variation, while contributing to the systematic erasure of the idea of contemporary Native peoples.&nbsp|

We will discuss legacies of colonialism and Cold War power struggles, as well as the active role indigenous peoples and social movements are playing in crafting Latin American futures. We will trace the ways the region is enmeshed in transnational processes and migrations and analyze the intersection of culture, race, gender, and class in shaping urban centers, rural hinterlands, and livelihood strategies within them. In particular, we will discuss how ethnographic research – the long-term fieldwork conducted by anthropologists – can enrich our understanding of hotly debated issues such as statecraft, borders, and shifting meanings of citizenship| in/security, human rights, and democratization| and, illicit economies, extractive industries, and development.

It examines the social context in which each selected model or "paradigm" took hold and the extent of cognitive sharing, by either intellectual borrowing or breakthrough. The development of contemporary theory will be examined both as internal to the discipline and as a response to changing intellectual climates and social milieu. The course will focus on each theory in action, as the theoretical principles and methods apply to ethnographic case studies.

We will examine how ethnographic film emerged in a particular intellectual and political economic context as well as how subsequent conceptual and formal innovations have shaped the genre. We will also consider social responses to ethnographic film in terms of the contexts for producing and circulating these works| the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation| and the development of indigenous media and other practices in conversation with ethnographic film. Throughout the course, we will situate ethnographic film within the larger project for representing "culture," addressing the status of ethnographic film in relation to other documentary practices, including written ethnography, museum exhibitions, and documentary film.

The first unit will focus on human genetic diversity and the increasing use of genetic information in society. Included in this unit will be discussions of genetic ancestry testing and the construction of identity. The second unit will examine in more detail the genetic basis of phenotypic traits and disease, exploring what our genes can reveal about us while also considering the problems of biological determinism. The final unit will extend the understanding of human biological variation by looking at the relationship between humans and our environment, how our environment changed throughout prehistory and contemporary times, and what role the environment plays in shaping human variation.

The emergent structure and function of ecosystems are regulated by feedbacks between biological and physical systems from the microscopic to the global scale. We will study how ecosystems cycle carbon and nutrients and how the energy balance of ecosystems creates critical feedbacks with climate. We will also examine the role that humans play in managing, creating, and using services from ecosystems in our current era of rapid global change. Students will develop statistical skills working with real datasets from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and will gain experience collecting new field data from nearby LTER sites to understand temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem processes.

How did butterflies get eyespots? What is the evolutionary origin of bird feathers? How did snakes get to be so long? How did humans evolve? The field of evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo, integrates the long-separate fields of evolutionary biology and developmental biology to answer these questions.

The course sets out a basic timeline of events, then turns to literary and philosophical sources to illustrate the dynasty&rsquo|s internal weaknesses during its last half century. Externally, the Japanese invasion of Korea was another destabilizer, as can again be shown through literary and philosophical readings. The fall had profound repercussions within China, paving the way for a new Qing (Manchu)Dynasty and reshaping some areas of Chinese culture, with additional repercussions in the literatures of Korea and Japan. Not long after the transition, accounts of events turn up in the literatures of England, Holland, and France, some of which seem quite fanciful if one knows the Chinese side of the story. Overall, this picture provides a sense of China&rsquo|s place in regional and world culture nearly four hundred years before the present day.

Unique Chinese film genres such as left-wing melodrama, martial arts films and model play adaptations, as well as the three "new waves" in China's recent avant-garde cinema, will be examined and discussed. Individual filmic visions and techniques experimented with by important directors such as Fei Mu, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Zhang Yimou, and Jia Zhangke will be closely analyzed. Class discussions will aim to help students understand the history, politics, and aesthetics of Chinese cinema. Theoretical aspects of film studies will also be incorporated into class readings and discussions. No prior knowledge of China or film studies is required.

It begins with the short form known as zaju</em> of the Yuan Dynasty (thirteenth to the fourteenth centuries), when dramatic works began to be written by identifiable authors. Next come the long and elaborate chuanqi</em> (or kunqu</em>) of the Ming and Qing Dynasties (fourteenth to twentieth centuries), including the still performed performed Peony Pavilion by Tang Xianzu. The last category is Peking opera, a form that originated during the second half of the Qing Dynasty, around 1790, and is regularly performed today. Most of our dramas were written by men, but we will also look at a few by women. The interrelation between forms will be discussed, as will the effects of the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 on Peking opera and other opera forms.&nbsp| Lastly such perennial themes as Mulan and The White Snake will be surveyed.&nbsp| This course may be taken as CHIN 244 or, with additional assignments as CHIN 344.

What makes a story feel &ldquo|nightmarish,&rdquo| &ldquo|trancelike&rdquo| or &ldquo|dreamy&rdquo| and can we pinpoint the features that generate such impressions? Why do we care so much about characters we meet in books? Cognitive poetics is an emerging approach to literary studies that seeks to answer such questions.  It applies insights drawn from cognitive science, psychology and linguistics to literary texts to reveal how novels and poems make us feel the way they do. Each week, we will read cutting edge research in this exciting new field and ask how it helps us make sense of literary texts. These texts will range widely through different languages, cultures and times, from ancient Greek epics to contemporary science fiction. The course will appeal to students with interests in literature, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, medicine and beyond but it requires no previous experience in any of these areas.

Critics of world literature argue that a text&rsquo|s richness may be lost in translation, that too often a privileged Western literary tradition forces &ldquo|other&rdquo| literatures into a relationship of belatedness and inferiority, and that world literature leads to the globalization of culture&mdash|and as the global language becomes predominantly English, the world of literature will be known through that single language alone. This course offers an opportunity to not only read rich and exciting literary texts from ancient eras to the contemporary moment but also after reading key critical essays that defend and critique &ldquo|World Literature&rdquo| to reflect on the cultural politics that directly or indirectly determines who reads what. Likely texts among others:&nbsp|The Homeric Hymn to Demeter|&nbsp|</em>Ovid,&nbsp|Metamorphoses</em>| Murasaki,&nbsp|The Tale of the Genji</em>| Qu,&nbsp|The Lament</em>| Poe,&nbsp|Tales</em>| Dove,&nbsp|Mother Love</em>| Akutagawa,&nbsp|Stories</em>| Soyinka,&nbsp|Ak&eacute|</em>| Ma,&nbsp|Red Dust</em>| Spivak, &ldquo|Crossing Borders&rdquo|| Saussy, &ldquo|Exquisite Cadavers Stitched from Fresh Nightmares: Of Memes, Hives, and Selfish Genes&rdquo|| Cao, &ldquo|Cross-Civilization Variation Theory."

Beginning with the 'modern girl, we move chronologically, exploring coming-of-age tropes in East Asian fiction, manga, anime and film. How does the objectification of the adolescent girl illuminate issues around ethnicity, national identity, sexuality, even globalization? What national anxieties hover around girls' bodies? We read texts in English translation and explore models of female development that might aid us in our exploration of this cultural phenomenon. Secondary readings include works by Sigmund Freud, Julia Kristeva, Marianne Hirsch, Carol Gilligan, Elizabeth Grosz, among others.
