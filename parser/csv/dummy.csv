Required for all students majoring in Cinema and Media Studies. ;Cinema's first century is a vast, wondrous universe where art, media technology, and political economy variously intertwine. This course charts a path through this universe by casting a spotlight on exemplary constellations: films that captured our imagination, significant artists, groundbreaking movements, transnational synergies. Part 2 surveys postwar film history until the end of the twentieth century. We examine the worldwide emergence and energy of new cinemas during the epochal changes brought about by sexual and cultural revolutions, postcolonialism, and multiculturalism. Against the background of a shifting world order and technological transformations affecting how films are made, distributed, and viewed, we shall explore the vexed question of art cinema's implicit opposition to the ethos of fast consumption, asking ourselves: whither cinema after its hundredth anniversary?

What were the consequences of that fall? The course sets out a basic timeline of events, then turns to literary and philosophical sources to illustrate the dynasty&rsquo|s internal weaknesses during its last half century. Externally, the Japanese invasion of Korea was another destabilizer, as can again be shown through literary and philosophical readings. The fall had profound repercussions within China, paving the way for a new Qing (Manchu)Dynasty and reshaping some areas of Chinese culture, with additional repercussions in the literatures of Korea and Japan. Not long after the transition, accounts of events turn up in the literatures of England, Holland, and France, some of which seem quite fanciful if one knows the Chinese side of the story. Overall, this picture provides a sense of China&rsquo|s place in regional and world culture nearly four hundred years before the present day.

What makes a story feel &ldquo|nightmarish,&rdquo| &ldquo|trancelike&rdquo| or &ldquo|dreamy&rdquo| and can we pinpoint the features that generate such impressions? Why do we care so much about characters we meet in books? Cognitive poetics is an emerging approach to literary studies that seeks to answer such questions.  It applies insights drawn from cognitive science, psychology and linguistics to literary texts to reveal how novels and poems make us feel the way they do. Each week, we will read cutting edge research in this exciting new field and ask how it helps us make sense of literary texts. These texts will range widely through different languages, cultures and times, from ancient Greek epics to contemporary science fiction.

What makes a story feel &ldquo|nightmarish,&rdquo| &ldquo|trancelike&rdquo| or &ldquo|dreamy&rdquo| and can we pinpoint the features that generate such impressions? Why do we care so much about characters we meet in books? Cognitive poetics is an emerging approach to literary studies that seeks to answer such questions.  It applies insights drawn from cognitive science, psychology and linguistics to literary texts to reveal how novels and poems make us feel the way they do. Each week, we will read cutting edge research in this exciting new field and ask how it helps us make sense of literary texts. These texts will range widely through different languages, cultures and times, from ancient Greek epics to contemporary science fiction. The course will appeal to students with interests in literature, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, medicine and beyond but it requires no previous experience in any of these areas.

Beginning with the 'modern girl, we move chronologically, exploring coming-of-age tropes in East Asian fiction, manga, anime and film. How does the objectification of the adolescent girl illuminate issues around ethnicity, national identity, sexuality, even globalization? What national anxieties hover around girls' bodies? We read texts in English translation and explore models of female development that might aid us in our exploration of this cultural phenomenon. Secondary readings include works by Sigmund Freud, Julia Kristeva, Marianne Hirsch, Carol Gilligan, Elizabeth Grosz, among others.

How do individuals, communities, and political structures change?  This seminar combines a reading of the social science literature on change with our own efforts to put that information into action. We’ll figure out how to change our own habits, change someone else’s mind, and how to invoke or transform community norms.  We’ll experiment with what approaches to political change succeed or fail. We’ll also examine what types of change are most important: does it matter whether people undertake their behavior for the right reasons, or simply that they act in ways that are better for environmental protection?  When should we focus on changing behavior by individuals, and when should we focus on changing the structures within which that behavior happens?

How should we understand the value of nature? Is it relative to human interests, or independent of them? What is nature in the first place, and how is it distinguished from culture? Is scientific or cultural knowledge relevant to the aesthetic experience of nature? Does “natural beauty” have a role to play in guiding environmental preservation? When we seek to preserve an ecosystem or a building, what exactly should we be aiming to preserve? Should the history of a place guide our interactions with it? How should we navigate conflicts between environmental and cultural preservation, especially as they intersect with issues of race and class? How should a changing climate affect our environmental values? We will investigate these questions, among others, in contexts from wilderness to parks, cities to ruins.

In this course, we will engage with such questions and related environmental sustainability issues as public writers. Students will choose one environmental issue, which will be the focus of their environmental “beat” during the semester. They will draw on an interdisciplinary toolset from environmental studies to analyze and communicate the scientific, economic, political, and ethical dimensions of pressing policy issues. Students will conduct independent research to produce weekly articles, such as op-eds, blog posts, press releases, book reviews, policy memos, and interviews with environmental professionals. Class sessions will be organized as writing workshops focused on the interdisciplinary analysis and content of student work.

We will study not only familiar genres such as the novel and poetry, but also less "mainstream" ones: fairy tales and letters. We will view these women not as the object of man's desire or discourse, but as subjects thinking and creating independently, expressing their desires, their wishes for themselves and humanity, their vision of society and the world, their own experience of love, power and powerlessness. Special attention is given to the continuities among women writers and to the impact of their minority status upon their writing.

We will begin with an analysis of exemplary tales and variants, examining these in the framework of a range of critical approaches. We will then trace the evolution of the genre in terms of two very different tracks: in the Kunstmärchen and in contemporary children’s literature. In addition to giving students an understanding of the foundational function of these tales, this course will develop students’ communicative and analytical skills, focusing on complex written and oral argumentation and critical reading of progressively longer texts. Select grammar topics will be reviewed over the course of the semester.

This course will explore the development of American capitalism from its birth in the mercantile world of imperial Great Britain through the financial ruin of the Great Depression. This course will closely examine the relationship between government, business, and society by engaging key moments in nineteenth-century American economic history: the rise of the corporation, transportation and communication innovations, industrialization, American slavery and commodity production, financial speculation and panics, the development of American banking, immigration policy, and labor relations.

This course examines Cold War politics, culture, and foreign policies in relation to various national developments&mdash|including the rise of social movements, changes in city landscapes, and the &ldquo|birth of the cool"&mdash|and international events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis and conflicts concerning Vietnam. Bearing on these developments were opportunities and limitations that accompanied ideological struggles between the United States and the Soviet Union, the rise of new cultural industries, and demographic shifts in the United States. Broad topic areas include: U.S. foreign policies| conformity and deviation along lines of gender, race, and sexuality| and domestic and foreign perceptions of the United States in a Cold War context.

It is a bloody but fascinating history, with plenty of twists and turns. We will investigate colonial American culture and ordinary life (including gender, family life, ecology, the material world, religion, and magical belief), as well as the struggles experienced by the earliest colonists and the imperial competition that characterized the colonial period. Between 1607 and 1763, a florid variety of cultures bloomed on the North American continent. We will explore these, with an eye toward understanding how the English colonies emerged from very uncertain beginnings to become&mdash|by the mid-eighteenth century&mdash|the prevailing power on the continent.
14029;HIST 265 History of Modern Africa;HIST;265;History of Modern Africa;TF;11:10 am;12:20 pm;1;17;8;25;;HS;Historical Studies;None ;Many of Africa's current characteristics are the legacy of colonial domination. We will therefore first study different kinds of colonies, from those settled by White planters to the "Cinderellas" in which colonial economic intervention was (by comparison) minimal and the struggle for independence less bloody. For the post-independence period, we will focus on the historical roots of such major themes as neocolonialism, economic underdevelopment, ethnic conflict and genocide, HIV/AIDS, and the problems of the African state. However, Africa's enormous natural and human resources, its resilient and youthful population, and its vibrant popular culture&mdash|a strong antidote against Afro-pessimism&mdash|will help us reflect on the future of this vast continent.

Yet this same region gave birth to other, perhaps more powerful, cultural legacies&mdash|jazz and the blues, the freedom struggle and Jim Crow&mdash|a heritage both uniquely Southern and yet deeply American. To better understand this region that has always seemed to stand apart, this course will examine the early history of the American South from the Revolutionary War through the beginning of the twentieth century. Topics covered will include: African American slavery and emancipation, the Civil War, Reconstruction, the spread of evangelical Christianity, Indian Removal, African American culture, and the rise of Jim Crow segregation.

These cannot be understood without a consideration of both the specific history of South Asia and a broader account of urban change. This course examines these changes in historical perspective and situates urban South Asia within a global context. How did colonial rule transform old cities such as Delhi and Lahore? How were the differing ideologies of India and Pakistan mapped onto new capitals such as Chandigarh and Islamabad? How are ethnic pasts and techno futures reconciled in booming cities such as Bangalore and Mumbai? What are the connections between the urban environment and political mobilization? We consider a range of sources, including scholarly literature, films, and short stories.

Our primary focus is the war in Europe, including Poland and Russia, although we will also consider the United States and Japan. We will investigate the construction of individual and collective memories about World War II and the creation and subsequent transformation of set myths about the war experience. In addition to books and articles, sources will include memoirs, primary documents, and films. We will also study the impact of war memories on international relations and analyze the "monumental politics" of war memorials.

We will examine how African Americans have produced, used, and appeared in the visual media of news, entertainment, and marketing industries, and evaluate the significance of their representation to both black and non-black political and social agendas. Areas of inquiry will include the intersections between U.S. visual culture and race relations, African Americans' use of visual culture as a means of self- and group-expression, and the state's use of black media images. This exploration will take us through a study of Jim Crow politics, black migrations and artistic movement, U.S. foreign relations and conflicts, and the development of marketing and advertising.&nbsp|

We then go on to study twentieth-century narrative texts, all the time seeking answers to the question of why narrative is such a fundamental human need. Why, for example, do we narrate our experience of life and the sense we have of ourselves, even in the form of diaries? Do the stories we tell faithfully reflect reality or do they create it? The course concludes with a reflection on narrative technique in cinema illustrated by the films of Antonioni. Other authors to be studied may include Calvino, Ceresa, Rasy, Pasolini, Celati, and Benni.

Not open to students who took MATH 349 when advanced linear algebra was the topic. ;Linear algebra at this more advanced level is a basic tool in many areas of mathematics and other fields. The course begins by revisiting some linear algebra concepts from MATH 206 in a more sophisticated way, making use of the mathematical maturity picked up in MATH 305. Such topics include vector spaces, linear independence, bases, and dimensions, linear transformations, and inner product spaces. Then we will turn to new notions, including dual spaces, reflexivity, annihilators, direct sums and quotients, tensor products, multilinear forms, and modules. One of the main goals of the course is the derivation of canonical forms, including triangular form and Jordan canonical forms. These are methods of analyzing matrices that are more general and powerful than diagonalization (studied in MATH 206). We will also discuss the spectral theorem, the best example of successful diagonalization, and its applications.

Neuroethology seeks to answer these questions by applying techniques from neurobiology to a whole-animal approach. In other words, neuroethology seeks to understand how a nervous system translates information from the external and internal environment to behavior by examining the whole animal in its natural (or as close to natural as possible) state. Topics will be introduced via textbook and primary literature and reviewed in lecture, followed by student-led presentations and discussions. What are the moral and societal implications of gaining a better understanding of how the brain controls behavior? We will end with an introduction to the neuroscience of morality and philosophy.

Two questions will animate the course: What is a friend? And, why are friends valuable? Drawing examples from literature and films, we will examine different types of friendships and the features that characterize and sustain them. Many philosophers have argued that the best kind of friendship is one in which the friend is loved for her own sake| we will consider whether this is truly possible or whether all friendships are ultimately instrumental. We'll also examine how the partiality inherent in friendship conflicts with the demands of standard moral theories. Finally, we will compare the love that characterizes friendship with the feelings that sustain relationships with parents, children, and lovers.

We will first consider the nature of law and legal reasoning. Is law derived from moral principles or created by legislative fiat? Is international “law” law? When judges interpret the Constitution, do they discover the law or, in effect, make it up as they go along? We will then discuss moral limits on the law.  Which principles should guide the state’s restriction of citizens’ liberties? Is refusal to obey the law ever justified? We will also consider the legal issues surrounding responsibility and penalties. Under which circumstances can we hold people responsible for outcomes that they caused or could have prevented?  What, if anything, justifies punishment by the state?  Does the death penalty violate human rights? Readings will include selections from legal theory and contemporary court decisions.

How should we understand the value of nature? Is it relative to human interests, or independent of them? What is nature in the first place, and how is it distinguished from culture? Is scientific or cultural knowledge relevant to the aesthetic experience of nature? Does “natural beauty” have a role to play in guiding environmental preservation? When we seek to preserve an ecosystem or a building, what exactly should we be aiming to preserve? Should the history of a place guide our interactions with it? How should we navigate conflicts between environmental and cultural preservation, especially as they intersect with issues of race and class? How should a changing climate affect our environmental values? We will investigate these questions, among others, in contexts from wilderness to parks, cities to ruins.

In reality, however, there are many instances of asymmetric conflicts involving non-state actors who avoid open battles, whose fighters are indistinguishable from civilians, and who seek a wide variety of political objectives. Peasant revolts, communist insurrections, ethnic rebellions, and terrorist movements are among the various ways in which the weak have attempted to use violence to break the will of the strong. We address these wars from a theoretical, historical, and contemporary perspective. We will explore how classical theorists, including Mao Zedong and Che Guevara, adapted the ideas of Clausewitz to guerilla warfare. We will examine how rebel groups&mdash|whether the Spanish guerillas, Boer commandos, Chinese communists, or Serb militias&mdash|employed violence to intimidate their opponents. We will consider how globalization and the diffusion of military technology have transformed guerilla conflicts, and debate the implications of our theories for contemporary conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan.

This course examines one aspect of this tension: the co-development of political discourses of liberty and equality in tandem with carceral discourses and institutions from early American society through the rise of the contemporary prison state. Throughout the course, we will ask the question: Is state subordination and control of certain social groups necessary to the enactment of American ideals, or can we imagine America beyond the carceral state?

Together with the “Don Juan” and the “rogue/trickster” (“el pícaro”)—two literary archetypes bequeathed by Spain to the world, models for defining aspects of manhood will include the battling hero, the saint, the villain, the “average guy,” and the philosopher.  Emphasis will be placed on how these figures interact with and defined by interaction with women and how the un-enunciated queer is ever present.  Together with examining how masculinity reflects notions of honor, virility, social order, religion, and misogyny, the course will consider medical and biological models of manhood and how those framed gender.

How can it move us to tears, give us goosebumps, make us want to dance, or conjure powerful memories? In this course, we will investigate these questions by considering music&rsquo|s relationship to three kinds of human experience&mdash|trauma, ecstasy, and fantasy. We will consider how music impacts war veterans, abuse survivors, and people suffering from mental and emotional disorders. We will study the transcendent musical emotions of people who participate in religious rituals, &ldquo|superfans&rdquo| who follow bands on tour, devotees of drag culture, and participants in large-scale events such as Burning Man and Coachella. Finally, we will study individuals who claim to have no affinity for music, as well as people who suffer from amusia, the neurological inability to process musical pitch.

Open only to first-year students. ;Fascinating cultural practices are found not only in far-off places but are also embedded in the stories of our everyday lives. From our families and friends to taxi drivers and grocery clerks, everyone's personal history has something to teach us. Written accounts of culture (called ethnographies) are created from these narratives of how people live their lives. What extraordinary stories of culture are hidden in local, everyday places? What does it mean to write someone else's story? Or our own? What can we learn about culture by translating oral histories into words? With the understanding that some of the most interesting stories about human culture are told in our own backyards, we will approach writing through ethnographic storytelling, using our life experiences as our subject.

13760;WRIT 167 Saints and Sinners in the Middle Ages;WRIT;167;Saints and Sinners in the Middle Ages;MTh;09:50 am;11:00 am;1;15;0;15;;W;W;None. Open only to first-year students. ;In medieval Europe, biographies of saints were one of the most popular forms of literature, providing readers and listeners with examples of saintly behavior to emulate and sinful actions to avoid.   More importantly the biographies narrated the lives of some of the most important members of medieval society.   Whether living or dead, saints were seen as liminal beings able to move between this world and the next, communicating God’s will to their fellow Christians and harnessing divine power to perform miracles.  This course will examine the lives of a diverse group of male and female saints from the Middle Ages (c. 300-1300 C. E.), utilizing the sacred biographies both as a means for understanding medieval society and as a springboard for addressing larger issues connected to the aims and function of biographical writing and the question of whether or not an “objective” biography is ever possible.

Open only to first-year students. ;In this course we will investigate the transformative journey art takes when it is adapted for performance. We will examine what happens to art as it moves from short story to stage, from board game to cult film, from graphic novel to Tony-winning musical and beyond. We will explore what motivates an artist to adapt a work into a new medium, considering what is gained or lost in the process of re-creation. Our work will be to understand the form, content, and social context of various artistic sources, to assess public and critical reception of their adapted forms, and to propose potential new directions for artistic re-creation.

Not open to first-year students. ;The goal of the course is to develop an understanding of the fundamental principles of genetics at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. The mechanisms that regulate the control of gene expression leading to alteration in phenotype during cellular differential will be studied. A link will be established between the generation of genetic variants through mutation and recombination, their patterns of inheritance, interactions between genes to produce complex phenotypes, and the maintenance of such genetic variation in natural populations. Topics will include: organization of the eukaryotic genome, gene structure and function, multilevel gene control and dysregulation in disease, genetics of pattern formation, inheritance of gene differences, gene and allele interactions, and aspects of population and evolutionary genetics. Laboratory investigation will expose students to the fundamentals of genetics including classical and molecular techniques for genetic analysis.&nbsp||<em>Students must attend lab during the first week in order to continue in the course.&nbsp|</em>|Lab requires students to come in outside of scheduled lab time - generally 3 days after the scheduled lab.

But how did it get this way, and will it always be so nice?  We will explore Earth’s place in the Universe in both space and time, focusing on processes that led to the Earth as we know it. We then will examine cosmic, geologic, and human processes that are altering our planet at a time when humans have become change agents on a global scale. This interdisciplinary, studio-style course features two long blocks per week with hands-on activities including group work, discussions, and projects with non-traditional assessment tailored to individual student goals. There will be opportunities for nighttime telescopic observing along with field trips to rock outcrops that preserve evidence of a very different early Earth climate.

<p class="CourseDescription">Milton helped set the standard of literary power for generations of writers after him. His epic <em>Paradise Lost </em>exemplifies poetic inspiration, sublimity, creativity, originality, and unconventionality, offering a richness of meaning and emotion that seems to provoke violently incompatible interpretations, even radical uncertainty about whether his work is good or bad. This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways. We will consider Milton as the prototype of a new kind of poet who pushes meaning to its limit, from his early writings, to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Paradise Regain&rsquo|d</em> at his career&rsquo|s end, and sample the range of critical responses his poetry has elicited.|

Ecosystems are essential to sustaining life on Earth. The emergent structure and function of ecosystems are regulated by feedbacks between biological and physical systems from the microscopic to the global scale. We will study how ecosystems cycle carbon and nutrients and how the energy balance of ecosystems creates critical feedbacks with climate. We will also examine the role that humans play in managing, creating, and using services from ecosystems in our current era of rapid global change. Students will develop statistical skills working with real datasets from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and will gain experience collecting new field data from nearby LTER sites to understand temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem processes.

<p class="CourseDescription">Milton helped set the standard of literary power for generations of writers after him. His epic <em>Paradise Lost </em>exemplifies poetic inspiration, sublimity, creativity, originality, and unconventionality, offering a richness of meaning and emotion that seems to provoke violently incompatible interpretations, even radical uncertainty about whether his work is good or bad. This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways. We will consider Milton as the prototype of a new kind of poet who pushes meaning to its limit, from his early writings, to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Paradise Regain&rsquo|d</em> at his career&rsquo|s end, and sample the range of critical responses his poetry has elicited.|

Ecosystems are essential to sustaining life on Earth. The emergent structure and function of ecosystems are regulated by feedbacks between biological and physical systems from the microscopic to the global scale. We will study how ecosystems cycle carbon and nutrients and how the energy balance of ecosystems creates critical feedbacks with climate. We will also examine the role that humans play in managing, creating, and using services from ecosystems in our current era of rapid global change. Students will develop statistical skills working with real datasets from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and will gain experience collecting new field data from nearby LTER sites to understand temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem processes.

His epic <em>Paradise Lost </em>exemplifies poetic inspiration, sublimity, creativity, originality, and unconventionality, offering a richness of meaning and emotion that seems to provoke violently incompatible interpretations, even radical uncertainty about whether his work is good or bad. This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways. We will consider Milton as the prototype of a new kind of poet who pushes meaning to its limit, from his early writings, to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Paradise Regain&rsquo|d</em> at his career&rsquo|s end, and sample the range of critical responses his poetry has elicited.|

Open to First-Year students only. ;Beyond the social construct of gender, what are the actual differences between the sexes? How do variations in the hard wiring of our brains, in our hormones and in our biochemistry make women and men different? Do men and women fall into distinct categories or onto a continuum?  We will investigate the biochemical origins and consequences of female/male differences in our minds, our bodies, our affections and our abilities. Lectures, active learning exercises and class discussions of papers from the primary literature will allow students to acquire a basic understanding of biochemical processes and gain insights into the methods used to address scientific questions. Writing assignments will challenge students to investigate what it means to be a woman in the 21st century.

Ecosystems are essential to sustaining life on Earth. The emergent structure and function of ecosystems are regulated by feedbacks between biological and physical systems from the microscopic to the global scale. We will study how ecosystems cycle carbon and nutrients and how the energy balance of ecosystems creates critical feedbacks with climate. We will also examine the role that humans play in managing, creating, and using services from ecosystems in our current era of rapid global change. Students will develop statistical skills working with real datasets from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and will gain experience collecting new field data from nearby LTER sites to understand temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem processes.

Students must attend lab during the first week to continue in the course. ;<p class="sc-BodyText">This gateway course provides an integrated introduction to the application of chemical principles to understand biological systems and covers the content of both BISC 110/112 and CHEM 105.&nbsp| It is designed for students whose interests lie at the interface of chemistry and biology and must be taken concurrently with BISC 116. Students will learn how structure and function of biological systems are shaped by principles of atomic properties and chemical bonding. Cellular metabolism and molecular genetics are integrated with quantitative introductions to thermodynamics, equilibrium, and kinetics. Other topics motivated by the application of chemistry to biology include nuclear chemistry and cellular growth and differentiation. The laboratory is a hands-on introduction to spectroscopy, microscopy, and other experimental techniques, as well as quantitative analysis, experimental design, and scientific writing. Successful completion of this course enables a student to take any course for which either CHEM105 or BISC110/112 is a prerequisite.

His epic <em>Paradise Lost </em>exemplifies poetic inspiration, sublimity, creativity, originality, and unconventionality, offering a richness of meaning and emotion that seems to provoke violently incompatible interpretations, even radical uncertainty about whether his work is good or bad. This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways. We will consider Milton as the prototype of a new kind of poet who pushes meaning to its limit, from his early writings, to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Paradise Regain&rsquo|d</em> at his career&rsquo|s end, and sample the range of critical responses his poetry has elicited.|

Many marine mammals thrive in arctic waters, sense the world around them using sound, and move with phenomenal efficiency. In this course, we will learn the physics underlying the remarkable abilities of these aquatic mammals. Marine mammal characteristics and the associated scientific topics include diving and swimming (ideal gas law, fluids, and forces)| metabolism (energy, thermodynamics, and scaling)| and senses (waves, acoustics, and optics). This course represents a naturally interdisciplinary approach in connecting biology, chemistry, and engineering principles to the physics we will study as we learn about these animals. The course also emphasizes the development of modeling and problem-solving techniques. Whale watch. Not to be counted toward the minimum major or to fulfill entrance requirement for medical school.

The mechanisms that regulate the control of gene expression leading to alteration in phenotype during cellular differential will be studied. A link will be established between the generation of genetic variants through mutation and recombination, their patterns of inheritance, interactions between genes to produce complex phenotypes, and the maintenance of such genetic variation in natural populations. Topics will include organization of the eukaryotic genome, gene structure and function, multilevel gene control and dysregulation in disease, genetics of pattern formation, inheritance of gene differences, gene and allele interactions, and aspects of population and evolutionary genetics.

Open to First-Year students only. ;Beyond the social construct of gender, what are the actual differences between the sexes? How do variations in the hard wiring of our brains, in our hormones and in our biochemistry make women and men different? Do men and women fall into distinct categories or onto a continuum?  We will investigate the biochemical origins and consequences of female/male differences in our minds, our bodies, our affections and our abilities. Lectures, active learning exercises and class discussions of papers from the primary literature will allow students to acquire a basic understanding of biochemical processes and gain insights into the methods used to address scientific questions. Writing assignments will challenge students to investigate what it means to be a woman in the 21st century.

Ecosystems are essential to sustaining life on Earth. The emergent structure and function of ecosystems are regulated by feedbacks between biological and physical systems from the microscopic to the global scale. We will study how ecosystems cycle carbon and nutrients and how the energy balance of ecosystems creates critical feedbacks with climate. We will also examine the role that humans play in managing, creating, and using services from ecosystems in our current era of rapid global change. Students will develop statistical skills working with real datasets from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and will gain experience collecting new field data from nearby LTER sites to understand temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem processes.

Students must attend lab during the first week to continue in the course.;<p class="sc-BodyText">This gateway course provides an integrated introduction to the application of chemical principles to understand biological systems and covers the content of both BISC 110/112 and CHEM 105.&nbsp| It is designed for students whose interests lie at the interface of chemistry and biology and must be taken concurrently with BISC 116. Students will learn how structure and function of biological systems are shaped by principles of atomic properties and chemical bonding. Cellular metabolism and molecular genetics are integrated with quantitative introductions to thermodynamics, equilibrium, and kinetics. Other topics motivated by the application of chemistry to biology include nuclear chemistry and cellular growth and differentiation. The laboratory is a hands-on introduction to spectroscopy, microscopy, and other experimental techniques, as well as quantitative analysis, experimental design, and scientific writing. Successful completion of this course enables a student to take any course for which either CHEM105 or BISC110/112 is a prerequisite.

13161;ENG 227 Milton;ENG;227;Milton;TF;02:50 pm;04:00 pm;Founders Hall-423;Founders Hall;423;1;8;22;30;;LL;Language and Literature;None;[|]<p class="CourseDescription">Milton helped set the standard of literary power for generations of writers after him. His epic <em>Paradise Lost </em>exemplifies poetic inspiration, sublimity, creativity, originality, and unconventionality, offering a richness of meaning and emotion that seems to provoke violently incompatible interpretations, even radical uncertainty about whether his work is good or bad. This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways. We will consider Milton as the prototype of a new kind of poet who pushes meaning to its limit, from his early writings, to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Paradise Regain&rsquo|d</em> at his career&rsquo|s end, and sample the range of critical responses his poetry has elicited.|

Many marine mammals thrive in arctic waters, sense the world around them using sound, and move with phenomenal efficiency. In this course, we will learn the physics underlying the remarkable abilities of these aquatic mammals. Marine mammal characteristics and the associated scientific topics include diving and swimming (ideal gas law, fluids, and forces)| metabolism (energy, thermodynamics, and scaling)| and senses (waves, acoustics, and optics). This course represents a naturally interdisciplinary approach in connecting biology, chemistry, and engineering principles to the physics we will study as we learn about these animals. The course also emphasizes the development of modeling and problem-solving techniques. Whale watch. Not to be counted toward the minimum major or to fulfill entrance requirement for medical school.

Not open to first-year students.;The goal of the course is to develop an understanding of the fundamental principles of genetics at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. The mechanisms that regulate the control of gene expression leading to alteration in phenotype during cellular differential will be studied. A link will be established between the generation of genetic variants through mutation and recombination, their patterns of inheritance, interactions between genes to produce complex phenotypes, and the maintenance of such genetic variation in natural populations. Topics will include organization of the eukaryotic genome, gene structure and function, multilevel gene control and dysregulation in disease, genetics of pattern formation, inheritance of gene differences, gene and allele interactions, and aspects of population and evolutionary genetics. Laboratory investigation will expose students to the fundamentals of genetics including classical and molecular techniques for genetic analysis.|[|]<div><em>Students must attend lab during the first week in order to continue in the course</em>.|Lab requires students to come in outside of scheduled lab time - generally 3 days after the scheduled lab.&nbsp| Please plan your schedule ​accordingly[|]

Open to First-Year students only.;Beyond the social construct of gender, what are the actual differences between the sexes? How do variations in the hard wiring of our brains, in our hormones and in our biochemistry make women and men different? Do men and women fall into distinct categories or onto a continuum?  We will investigate the biochemical origins and consequences of female/male differences in our minds, our bodies, our affections and our abilities. Lectures, active learning exercises and class discussions of papers from the primary literature will allow students to acquire a basic understanding of biochemical processes and gain insights into the methods used to address scientific questions. Writing assignments will challenge students to investigate what it means to be a woman in the 21st century.

Ecosystems are essential to sustaining life on Earth. The emergent structure and function of ecosystems are regulated by feedbacks between biological and physical systems from the microscopic to the global scale. We will study how ecosystems cycle carbon and nutrients and how the energy balance of ecosystems creates critical feedbacks with climate. We will also examine the role that humans play in managing, creating, and using services from ecosystems in our current era of rapid global change. Students will develop statistical skills working with real datasets from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and will gain experience collecting new field data from nearby LTER sites to understand temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem processes.

His epic <em>Paradise Lost </em>exemplifies poetic inspiration, sublimity, creativity, originality, and unconventionality, offering a richness of meaning and emotion that seems to provoke violently incompatible interpretations, even radical uncertainty about whether his work is good or bad. This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways. We will consider Milton as the prototype of a new kind of poet who pushes meaning to its limit, from his early writings, to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Paradise Regain&rsquo|d</em> at his career&rsquo|s end, and sample the range of critical responses his poetry has elicited.|

Many marine mammals thrive in arctic waters, sense the world around them using sound, and move with phenomenal efficiency. In this course, we will learn the physics underlying the remarkable abilities of these aquatic mammals. Marine mammal characteristics and the associated scientific topics include diving and swimming (ideal gas law, fluids, and forces)| metabolism (energy, thermodynamics, and scaling)| and senses (waves, acoustics, and optics). This course represents a naturally interdisciplinary approach in connecting biology, chemistry, and engineering principles to the physics we will study as we learn about these animals. The course also emphasizes the development of modeling and problem-solving techniques. Whale watch. Not to be counted toward the minimum major or to fulfill entrance requirement for medical school.

Not open to first-year students.;The goal of the course is to develop an understanding of the fundamental principles of genetics at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. The mechanisms that regulate the control of gene expression leading to alteration in phenotype during cellular differential will be studied. A link will be established between the generation of genetic variants through mutation and recombination, their patterns of inheritance, interactions between genes to produce complex phenotypes, and the maintenance of such genetic variation in natural populations. Topics will include organization of the eukaryotic genome, gene structure and function, multilevel gene control and dysregulation in disease, genetics of pattern formation, inheritance of gene differences, gene and allele interactions, and aspects of population and evolutionary genetics. Laboratory investigation will expose students to the fundamentals of genetics including classical and molecular techniques for genetic analysis.|[|]<div><em>Students must attend lab during the first week in order to continue in the course</em>.|Lab requires students to come in outside of scheduled lab time - generally 3 days after the scheduled lab.&nbsp| Please plan your schedule ​accordingly[|]

Open to First-Year students only.;Beyond the social construct of gender, what are the actual differences between the sexes? How do variations in the hard wiring of our brains, in our hormones and in our biochemistry make women and men different? Do men and women fall into distinct categories or onto a continuum?  We will investigate the biochemical origins and consequences of female/male differences in our minds, our bodies, our affections and our abilities. Lectures, active learning exercises and class discussions of papers from the primary literature will allow students to acquire a basic understanding of biochemical processes and gain insights into the methods used to address scientific questions. Writing assignments will challenge students to investigate what it means to be a woman in the 21st century.

Ecosystems are essential to sustaining life on Earth. The emergent structure and function of ecosystems are regulated by feedbacks between biological and physical systems from the microscopic to the global scale. We will study how ecosystems cycle carbon and nutrients and how the energy balance of ecosystems creates critical feedbacks with climate. We will also examine the role that humans play in managing, creating, and using services from ecosystems in our current era of rapid global change. Students will develop statistical skills working with real datasets from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and will gain experience collecting new field data from nearby LTER sites to understand temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem processes.

His epic <em>Paradise Lost </em>exemplifies poetic inspiration, sublimity, creativity, originality, and unconventionality, offering a richness of meaning and emotion that seems to provoke violently incompatible interpretations, even radical uncertainty about whether his work is good or bad. This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways. We will consider Milton as the prototype of a new kind of poet who pushes meaning to its limit, from his early writings, to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Paradise Regain&rsquo|d</em> at his career&rsquo|s end, and sample the range of critical responses his poetry has elicited.|

A significant component of this course will involve learning how to write in a professional context and how to collaborate effectively on a project of consequence.&nbsp| Our aim is to provide students with a set of communication skills transferable to a variety of different fields and ones that will prepare them for the kinds of writing they will do beyond the Wellesley classroom.

Ecosystems are essential to sustaining life on Earth. The emergent structure and function of ecosystems are regulated by feedbacks between biological and physical systems from the microscopic to the global scale. We will study how ecosystems cycle carbon and nutrients and how the energy balance of ecosystems creates critical feedbacks with climate. We will also examine the role that humans play in managing, creating, and using services from ecosystems in our current era of rapid global change. Students will develop statistical skills working with real datasets from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and will gain experience collecting new field data from nearby LTER sites to understand temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem processes.

His epic <em>Paradise Lost </em>exemplifies poetic inspiration, sublimity, creativity, originality, and unconventionality, offering a richness of meaning and emotion that seems to provoke violently incompatible interpretations, even radical uncertainty about whether his work is good or bad. This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways. We will consider Milton as the prototype of a new kind of poet who pushes meaning to its limit, from his early writings, to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Paradise Regain&rsquo|d</em> at his career&rsquo|s end, and sample the range of critical responses his poetry has elicited.|

Many marine mammals thrive in arctic waters, sense the world around them using sound, and move with phenomenal efficiency. In this course, we will learn the physics underlying the remarkable abilities of these aquatic mammals. Marine mammal characteristics and the associated scientific topics include diving and swimming (ideal gas law, fluids, and forces)| metabolism (energy, thermodynamics, and scaling)| and senses (waves, acoustics, and optics). This course represents a naturally interdisciplinary approach in connecting biology, chemistry, and engineering principles to the physics we will study as we learn about these animals. The course also emphasizes the development of modeling and problem-solving techniques. Whale watch. Not to be counted toward the minimum major or to fulfill entrance requirement for medical school.

His epic <em>Paradise Lost </em>exemplifies poetic inspiration, sublimity, creativity, originality, and unconventionality, offering a richness of meaning and emotion that seems to provoke violently incompatible interpretations, even radical uncertainty about whether his work is good or bad. This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways. We will consider Milton as the prototype of a new kind of poet who pushes meaning to its limit, from his early writings, to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to <em>Paradise Regain&rsquo|d</em> at his career&rsquo|s end, and sample the range of critical responses his poetry has elicited.|

This course will focus on how this poem challenges and expands our views of God, evil, heroism, Hell, good, Heaven, pain, bliss, sex, sin, and failure in startling ways.

Many marine mammals thrive in arctic waters, sense the world around them using sound, and move with phenomenal efficiency. In this course, we will learn the physics underlying the remarkable abilities of these aquatic mammals. Marine mammal characteristics and the associated scientific topics include diving and swimming (ideal gas law, fluids, and forces)| metabolism (energy, thermodynamics, and scaling)| and senses (waves, acoustics, and optics). This course represents a naturally interdisciplinary approach in connecting biology, chemistry, and engineering principles to the physics we will study as we learn about these animals. The course also emphasizes the development of modeling and problem-solving techniques. Whale watch. Not to be counted toward the minimum major or to fulfill entrance requirement for medical school.
